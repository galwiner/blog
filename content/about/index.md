# About me

My name is Gal. I'm an experimental physicist from Herzliya, Israel, a lovely coastal town just north of Tel Aviv. 

I am married to Danit and have two cute kids.

I did my physics Ph.D. at the Weizmann Institute under the supervision of [Prof. Ofer Firstenberg](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/Firstenberg/home), where I was the first student in the lab. My main experiment involved cold atoms and quantum optics using Rydberg atoms. I was also passionate about writing [scientific outreach articles](https://davidson.weizmann.ac.il/authors/%D7%92%D7%9C-%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A8) at the time, something I would like to revive in this blog.

Before coming to Weizmann,  I had worked on scanning optical microscopes for the semiconductor industry in Applied materials. I also spent one magical summer at CERN, where I was helping out with developing tools for the ATLAS data processing pipeline.

I have been happily active in the budding quantum computing industry for several years. I am primarily working on quantum control and quantum software and am very interested in improving the interface between quantum scientists and quantum computers.
