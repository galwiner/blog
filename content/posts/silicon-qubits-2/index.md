# Previously on : Silicon Qubits

[Last time]({{<relref path="../silicon-qubits/index.md" >}}) we covered some basic concepts in solid state physics. It wasn't everything there is to know, and does not make us experts on silicon qubits, but it's a fair bit. It's hopefully enough to get us through this post where we go deeper into this technology. 

I'm personally not an expert. There was a time in my professional past when I worked on electrical transport in magnetic systems. That's when you make current flow through little pieces of magnetic (and non-magnetic) materials and explore what happens. Though quantum effects were involved, it was not the sort of single quanta physics that occurs in silicon qubits. The currents involved in my research were macroscopic - measured in milli- or \\( \mu \\)- Amperes. When manipulating quantum information we work with single electrons, which is orders-of-magnitude  more subtle as I had previously mentioned. 

Why should you trust me then? why is my take on silicon qubits remotely credible? Well, you shouldn't! I don't trust me either. Luckily to cover this post with the respect it deserves, I was able to recruit a surprise guest. 

# Run Will, Run! üèÉ

A couple of years ago I was working for a company doing quantum control. I did a fair bit of work with clients, it was one of the best parts of the job as I got to work with a bunch of different qubit technologies. But I did have a favorite gang of clients to work with. It was (and is) a lovely collection of people working on the opposite side of the globe.

This is well known in the quantum community, but if you're an outsider or newcomer you may not be in on it. Australia is a quantum powerhouse. It's not just Rugby, surfing and Kangaroos (though those would already be enough!), they're top physicists too. I got to work with some of the top Australian scholars developing silicon qubits: the labs of Prof. Andrew Dzurak and Prof. Andrea Morello. Both teams hail from UNSW, the University of New South Wales, which is located in Sydney.

When we started working together it was during the height of Covid-19. Although I really wanted to physically be in Sydney to help set up the experiment they were working on, I could not. Australia was hermetically sealed, as was most of the world. So I had to help remotely, bridging both a time-difference and the face you aren't in the lab and can't fully see what's happening as things are being set up. It felt like being a technician helping to install an air-conditioner by shouting suggestions through a key-hole. In any case, it went well and I kept in touch with some of the students working there. 

In particular, Will Gilbert from the Dzurak group was one of the first people I worked with. Will is a positive who had since completed his Ph.D. a
